<h1>Machine Learning Repo</h1>

<h2>Contents</h2>

<p>The mindmap covers the following main topics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Supervised Learning
    <ul>
      <li>Regression (linear regression, logistic regression)</li>
      <li>Classification (SVM, decision trees, Bayes classification)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li>Unsupervised Learning
    <ul>  
      <li>Clustering (K-means, KNN)</li>
      <li>Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)</li>
      <li>Anomaly Detection</li>
      <li>Recommender Systems</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li>Reinforcement Learning
    <ul>
      <li>Key concepts (states, rewards, policies)</li>
      <li>Algorithms (Q-learning, Deep Q-Networks)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Advantages</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Comprehensive overview of key machine learning topics</li>
  <li>Detailed explanations and math behind the algorithms</li>
  <li>Covers both theoretical concepts and practical implementations</li>
  <li>Mindmap structure allows for clear relationships between topics</li>  
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>The mindmap provides a high-level overview of the content, while the markdown file contains all the details. Some ways to use this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Browse the mindmap to understand relationships between ML topics</li>
  <li>Refer to the markdown for detailed explanations on algorithms</li>
  <li>Follow the math and worked examples to understand implementations</li>
  <li>Use as a reference when applying algorithms to problems</li>
  <li>Learn the fundamental concepts before diving deeper</li> 
</ul>

<p>Overall, it serves both as a learning resource for ML basics as well as a reference guide for applying common ML techniques.</p>
